    "We thought we knew everything about fitness...We'd studied it, coached it, lived it. But then we became mums, and suddenly, everything we thought we knew went out the window.",
    "**We struggled with our pelvic floor.** Our cores felt weak, and our bodies just didn't bounce back the way we'd been told they would.",
