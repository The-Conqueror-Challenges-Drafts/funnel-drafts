    "mainText": "Traditional fitness gives you none of that, so your brain gives up. Virtual Challenges turn every move into an adventure. Pick a challenge, watch your progress along gorgeous routes, and unlock rewards at each milestone. And when you're done? You get a physical medal, just like a marathon. Simple, right? But crazy effective. Read on to see why over 1 million people have completed these challenges.",
